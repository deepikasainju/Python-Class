# we may have different projects  in our system that may require different package dependencies
# your project may have pandas version 2.1 whereas project2 may havr pandas version 2.5 in the same system
# so this arises a problem . I fyou want to work on project1 
then one of the packages must be uninstalled from your global system and another version must be installed 

# this probelm can be solved creating a virtual environment in your system
# virtual environment is an isolated environment to keep the packages required for your project
# it solves the problem of installing and uninstalling packages for different projects in a same system

# every python project must be done with a virtual environment activated

// pypi bata packages haru install garne

# virtual commands for virtual environment
1. python -m venv <environment_name(env, venv)>
    =creates a new virtual environment (for this session lets say "venv")

2.venv\Scripts\activate (for windows device enter this command in command prompt)
  source venv/bin/activate (for mac and linux devices)
    =activates the virtual environment

3. deactivate
  = deactivates the environment

4. pip install <package>(pandas)
  = install the packages

5. pip freeze
  = it displays the packages installed in the environment

6. pip freeze > requirements.txt
  = packages list vayeko files banaidinxa 
  = add all the dependencies of the project in requirements.txt file

7. pip install -r requirements.txt
  = recursively install all the packages in the virtual environment
