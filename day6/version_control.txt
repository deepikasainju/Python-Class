What is version control?
= There can be different versions of the same project which should be backward compatible
= These versions of the same project are maintained by the version control system
= There are diff version control system like git, mercurial etc. 
= Git is the most famous one

Why use a version control system?
= To maintain project versions efficiently and with less manual work
= For effective team collaboration 

= The project maintain with version control system is later uploaded somewhere in the cloud
= There are several cloud storage like google drive, onedrive, S3. 
But these donot cooperate with version control(e.g. git)
= So we should use such cloud services which understand version control. There arw several such services 
for example github, gitlab, gitbucket,etc.
