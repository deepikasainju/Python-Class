## Set elements are always unique
## Set doesnt support i ndexing and slicing
## are unordered. {1,2} and {2,3} are same\
## are mutable but every elements are immutable


# Creating an empty set
s=set()
# a={} this not an empty set

# creating non empty set
data={1,2,3,4}
fruits={"A","bab0","cat"}
a={1,"a",(1,2),2.2}
print(a)
 # a={[1,2],2} this not a valid set cause list is mutable
