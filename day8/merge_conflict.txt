If code written in one file of a project in one branch collides with
a code written in same file in different branch during the merging process then merge conflict arises

git add . 
git commit -m <commit_msg>
git merge <branch_name> //error aauxa so milaune ani feri git add . dekhi garne
 a=1
 b=2

 print(a-b)

 print(a*b)
 print(a%b)
print(a+a+b)

 print(a*a*b)
 print(a+b)
